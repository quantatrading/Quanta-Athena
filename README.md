**Quanta Athena: Market Neutral Intelligence for Volatile Markets**

In the institutional landscape, success depends on more than execution speed; it requires understanding *structure*.  
**Quanta Athena** operates within that structure. It quantifies how implied volatility, strike distance and time decay shape the probabilistic distribution of future prices.

Developed as the analytical core of the Quanta trading suite, Athena combines **options-informed analytics**, **statistical modelling** and **dynamic capital optimisation** into a single adaptive system.  
It continuously evaluates **put call parity**, **volatility skew** and **expected move distributions** to locate asymmetrical setups where risk is measurable and reward potential is statistically justified.

Athena does not chase volatility; it *interprets* it.  
By using real-time option mark data, Black-Scholes probability models and regime-aware scaling, Athena aligns its trade logic with prevailing volatility states, expanding or contracting intelligently as the structure of risk evolves.
