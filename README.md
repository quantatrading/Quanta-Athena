# About Quanta Athena

In the institutional landscape, success depends on far more than execution speed ‚Äî it requires understanding *structure*.  
**Quanta Athena** operates within that structure: it quantifies how implied volatility, strike distance, and time decay shape the probabilistic distribution of future prices.

Developed as the analytical core of the Quanta trading suite, Athena fuses **options-informed analytics**, **statistical modelling**, and **dynamic capital optimisation** into a single adaptive system.  
It continuously evaluates **put-call parity**, **volatility skew**, and **expected move distributions** to locate asymmetrical setups ‚Äî where risk is quantifiable and the reward profile is statistically justified.

Athena doesn‚Äôt chase volatility ‚Äî it *interprets* it.  
By using real-time option mark data, Black-Scholes probability models, and regime-aware scaling, Athena aligns its trade logic with prevailing volatility states ‚Äî expanding, contracting, or hedging intelligently as the structure of risk evolves.

## üîç Core Features

- **Black-Scholes Pricing & ITM Probability**  
  Computes theoretical call/put prices and *N(d‚ÇÇ)* probabilities using live implied volatility, strike, time-to-expiry, and risk-free rate assumptions.

- **Parity-Informed Spot Validation**  
  Derives a synthetic spot price from put-call parity to verify feed accuracy and directional bias, bridging the option and spot markets.

- **Option-Implied Rails**  
  Calculates volatility-based expiry bounds and straddle envelopes, dynamically adjusting order targets to current expected-move distributions.

- **Volatility-Adaptive Engine**  
  Recalibrates order offsets, overlap tolerances, and layer weights based on real-time implied volatility and skew behaviour.

- **Dynamic Capital Optimisation**  
  Allocates exposure in proportion to regime strength, targeting capital efficiency under varying liquidity and volatility conditions.

- **Confluence Scoring Framework**  
  Integrates multi-factor inputs ‚Äî structural price data, IV trends, skew slope, and time decay ‚Äî into a unified probabilistic signal.

- **Contextual Risk Management**  
  Modulates trade frequency, exposure, and stop parameters automatically as volatility regimes shift.

- **Data-Driven Execution Layer**  
  Low-latency order engine with adaptive rate-limiting, retry logic, and JSON state persistence for deterministic strategy recovery.
