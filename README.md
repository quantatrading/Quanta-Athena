# About Quanta Athena

In the institutional landscape, success depends on more than execution speed; it requires understanding *structure*.  
**Quanta Athena** operates within that structure. It quantifies how implied volatility, strike distance, and time decay shape the probabilistic distribution of future prices.

Developed as the analytical core of the Quanta trading suite, Athena combines **options-informed analytics**, **statistical modelling**, and **dynamic capital optimisation** into a single adaptive system.  
It continuously evaluates **put call parity**, **volatility skew**, and **expected move distributions** to locate asymmetrical setups where risk is measurable and reward potential is statistically justified.

Athena does not chase volatility; it *interprets* it.  
By using real-time option mark data, Black-Scholes probability models, and regime-aware scaling, Athena aligns its trade logic with prevailing volatility states, expanding or contracting intelligently as the structure of risk evolves.

## üîç Core Features

- **Black-Scholes Pricing and ITM Probability**  
  Computes theoretical call and put prices and *N(d2)* probabilities using live implied volatility, strike, time to expiry and the current risk-free rate.

- **Parity-Informed Spot Validation**  
  Derives a synthetic spot price from put call parity to verify feed accuracy and directional bias, linking the option and spot markets.

- **Option-Implied Rails**  
  Calculates volatility-based expiry bounds and straddle envelopes, dynamically adjusting order targets to the current expected move distribution.

- **Volatility-Adaptive Engine**  
  Recalibrates order offsets, overlap tolerances, and layer weights based on real-time implied volatility and skew behaviour.

- **Dynamic Capital Optimisation**  
  Allocates exposure in proportion to regime strength, maintaining capital efficiency across changing liquidity and volatility conditions.

- **Confluence Scoring Framework**  
  Integrates multiple analytical factors such as price structure, IV trends, skew slope and time decay into a unified probabilistic signal.

- **Contextual Risk Management**  
  Modulates trade frequency, exposure and stop parameters automatically as volatility regimes shift.

- **Data-Driven Execution Layer**  
  Low-latency order engine with adaptive rate limiting, retry logic and JSON state persistence for deterministic strategy recovery.
